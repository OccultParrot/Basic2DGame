# The Plan for today, 7/17/2023

- [ ] Finish making variables for Tile struct and Map class.
- [ ] Make a method to initialize the array TileMap and enter in all the tiles from the .XML file.

I've done none of this, and just started writing a bunch of documentation on the GlobalData file, TileMap file, and the Text file. :sob:

I'm just going to commit this and go to bed. I'll do this stuff tommorow probably.
